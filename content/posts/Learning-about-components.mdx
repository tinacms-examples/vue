## Markdown, Supercharged ðŸš€

Hello, the current date is <currentDateTime format="local" />. Markdown is a fantastic way to write content, but what if you need **real-time updates**, **structured callouts**, or even **interactive elements**?

Thatâ€™s where **dynamic components** come in. They allow you to **enhance your Markdown** by incorporating **live data, styled sections, and user engagement features**â€”all while keeping the simplicity of Markdown.

### **Making Content More Engaging**

With components, you can move beyond static text. Here's an example of a **styled callout**:

<callout text="Did you know? Components can bring your Markdown to life!" type="info" />

By combining **inline components** for dynamic timestamps and **block-level components**  for structured messaging, you can keep content fresh and informative.

## **Why Use Components in Markdown?**

* âœ” **Dynamic Content** â€“ Pull in real-time data instead of relying on static text.
* âœ” **Improved Readability** â€“ Highlight key information using **structured callouts**.
* âœ” **Better User Engagement** â€“ Make your content interactive with buttons, forms, and more.

## **Ways to Use Components Effectively**

1. **Display Live Data** â€“ Use components to show **real-time updates**.
2. **Highlight Important Information** â€“ Add visually distinct **callouts** to emphasize key points.
3. **Create Interactive Elements** â€“ Let users engage with the content using forms, buttons, or even custom queries.
